### This project is part of a [mono repo](https://github.com/JuanMartinUribe/mini-projects) with multiple mini projects.

***This project was part of Jonas Schmedtmann reacts course and I lost my personal progress on it, so this version (which is pretty similar to what I had) is directly [copied](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann/ultimate-react-course/tree/main/05-travel-list/final) from his source projects of the course.***
